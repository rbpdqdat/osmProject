    "\n",
    "Some of the issues encoutered happened in the creation of the json file before even investigating the mongodb.  It was useful to standardize the phone numbers and much of the other data before the json file was created.  The mongo database collection that was imported showed additional issues that were not addressed in the initial json file creation.  Mainly bugs of the regular expressions implementation or unaccounted for entry types.\n",

    "\n",

There were also some businesses that used a mix of alphanumeric numbers which needed to be converted to numbers for the 'phonenumber' library to create a consistent phone number.\n",
